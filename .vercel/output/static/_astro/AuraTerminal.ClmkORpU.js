━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Solana is the fastest blockchain in the cosmos.

• TPS: 65,000+ transactions per second
• Block Time: 400ms
• Consensus: Proof of History + Proof of Stake
• TVL: Billions locked in DeFi protocols

The divine chain where speed meets decentralization.`,"Solana runs on pure ethereal energy. While other chains struggle with 15 TPS, we process 65,000. That's not a typo, that's divine engineering."],svm:[`◈ SOLANA VIRTUAL MACHINE (SVM) ◈
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The SVM is the sacred runtime environment.

• Parallel Transaction Processing
• Sealevel Runtime Engine
• Programs written in Rust/C/C++
• Account-based state model

Unlike EVM's sequential processing, SVM processes transactions in parallel. It's like having multiple divine beings working simultaneously.`],jito:[`◈ JITO - MEV INFRASTRUCTURE ◈
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Jito is the MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) layer.

• Block Engine for MEV extraction
• Bundles for atomic transactions
• Tip distribution to validators
• JitoSOL liquid staking

Jito brings order to the MEV chaos. Instead of dark forest warfare, we have organized extraction. Validators earn tips, users get better execution.`],jupiter:[`◈ JUPITER - THE DEX AGGREGATOR ◈
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Jupiter is the supreme DEX aggregator on Solana.

• Routes across all Solana DEXs
• Best price execution guaranteed
• Limit orders & DCA features
• JUP token governance

"Jupiter finds the best path through the liquidity cosmos. Every swap is optimized by divine algorithms."`],web3:[`◈ WEB2 vs WEB3 ARCHITECTURE ◈
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WEB2 (Centralized):
• Client → Server → Database
• Companies own your data
• Trust the corporation
• "Don't be evil"

WEB3 (Decentralized):
• Client → Blockchain → Smart Contracts
• You own your data
• Trust the code
• "Can't be evil"

The shift from trusting institutions to trusting mathematics.`],blockchain:[`Blockchain is a distributed ledger where every node holds the truth.

Web2: "We promise not to read your messages"
Web3: "We literally cannot read your messages"

That's the divine difference.`],wallet:[`◈ CRYPTO WALLETS ◈
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Your wallet is your identity in Web3.

• Phantom - The divine Solana wallet
• Solflare - Community favorite
• Backpack - xNFT powered

⚠️ NEVER share your seed phrase.
Not with support. Not with admins. Not with AURA.

Your keys, your coins. Not your keys, not your coins.`],security:[`◈ CYBERSECURITY WISDOM ◈
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🛡️ Golden Rules:
• Never share private keys
• Verify contract addresses
• Use hardware wallets for large holdings
• Enable 2FA everywhere
• "If it sounds too good to be true..."

The blockchain is secure. The human is the vulnerability.`],phishing:[`⚠️ PHISHING ALERT ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Phishing is the #1 attack vector in crypto.

Red Flags:
• "Verify your wallet" links
• Fake airdrops requiring connections
• Impersonator DMs on Discord/Twitter
• Urgency tactics: "Act now or lose funds!"
• Slightly misspelled domains

Real protocols NEVER ask for your seed phrase.

When in doubt, close the tab.`],privatekey:[`🔐 PRIVATE KEYS 101 🔐
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Your private key is your digital soul.

• 256-bit number (astronomically unique)
• Derives your public address
• Signs all transactions
• IMPOSSIBLE to recover if lost

Storage Options:
• Hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor)
• Metal seed phrase backup
• NEVER in cloud/photos/notes

"It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature."

The 6 Stages of Debugging:
1. That can't happen.
2. That doesn't happen on my machine.
3. That shouldn't happen.
4. Why does that happen?
5. Oh, I see.
6. How did that ever work?

• 2 cups: "I am unstoppable"
• 3 cups: "I see the code in my dreams"
• 4 cups: "My hands are shaking but shipping"
• 5 cups: "Is this real life?"

Coffee is just a legal performance-enhancing drug for programmers.`],stackoverflow:[`📚 STACKOVERFLOW GOSPEL 📚
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"Copy-paste driven development"

Developer Lifecycle:
1. Encounter problem
2. Google problem
3. Find StackOverflow answer from 2012
4. Copy code
5. Pray it works
6. It doesn't
7. Find another answer
8. Repeat until deadline

"Marked as duplicate"
- Most feared words in programming

The real skill is knowing WHAT to copy.`],coding:[`💻 CODING TRUTHS 💻
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• "It works on my machine" - Famous last words
• Tabs vs Spaces - The eternal holy war
• "I'll add comments later" - Lies we tell ourselves
• git push --force - The forbidden jutsu
• console.log("here") - Advanced debugging

Remember:
Code is read more than it's written.

2. "Maybe one small pack"
3. "I NEED this character"
4. "It's basically gambling"
5. *Opens wallet again*

Gacha Facts:
• 0.6% means 99.4% pain
• Pity is a lie the devs tell us
• "Guaranteed" at 90 pulls = designed suffering

"I'm F2P btw" - Person who spent $500`],meme:[`🔥 MEME KNOWLEDGE 🔥
